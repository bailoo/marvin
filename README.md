ML-based approach to Artist Recommendation by StarClinch

## [StarClinch.com](https://starclinch.com)
StarClinch is the Indias largest online platform for booking performance artists and entertainers including Singers, Comedians, Celebrities,  Live Bands, DJs, Anchors, and Speakers for all type of Events ranging from Campus Events to Wedding Ceremonies. 
StarClinch gets approximately 100 queries daily from clients for 18,000+ registered Artists.

`Clients` have two options to book Artists for their Events. First, Client can search for artists using the [online platform](https://starclinch.com) and get Quotes for that Artist directly. Second, Clients can fill the Post Your Requirements [PYR](https://starclinch.com/requirement.html) form and submit it then, one of the Business team members would contact the Client to get more information regarding the event based on that Business Team would then pitch artists to the client which fall into the required category and budget.<br>
The second options require manual work from gathering information about the event to pitching artists to the client. 
`Marvin` project aims to automate the process of pitching artists to the users based on the information in the PYR Form.
