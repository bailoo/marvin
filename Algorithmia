We need a face detection API so that we can zoom in images when resizing them in CSS

I found the API on Algorithmia and I tried it on a sample image the results were something like this
API: https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/dlib/FaceDetection
     
"images": [
   {
     "detected_faces": [
       {
         "bottom": 350,
         "left": 349,
         "right": 617,
         "top": 82
       }
     ],
     "imageDimensions": {
       "height": 960,
       "width": 960
     }
